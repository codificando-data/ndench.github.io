description: Any interesting links I find that I don't include in a blog post

I often read something online and want to reference it weeks or months later. However I can never 
find it again.  So here is where I leave all the interesting links I find that I don't want to 
write an entire blog post about.

# PHP

* Run PHP code agains almost every version of PHP ever released in one go with 
[3v4l.org](https://3v4l.org). It even combines the output to make it easy to see the differences 
between versions.

* A really in depth look at comparing different ORM libraries in PHP:
[Objectively comparing ORM/DAL libraries](https://medium.com/@romaninsh/objectively-comparing-orm-dal-libraries-e4f095de80b5)

[Q&A session](https://murze.be/vancouver-phps-qa-session-with-taylor-otwell)
with Taylor Otwell.

* [PHP-PM](https://symfony.fi/entry/php-pm-1-0-launches-with-official-docker-images)
is a recently released alternative to PHP-FPM, written entirely in PHP. It 
looks pretty interesting and I'd like to play with it one day.

* A description of [setting up a Makefile](https://localheinz.com/blog/2018/01/24/makefile-for-lazy-developers/)

commands you need to run in your project to come through a common interface.

describing how easy it would be to harvest credit card numbers from a large portion of sites on 
the internet. Just by creating a dodgy npm package and getting other popular packages to depend on 
it.

* An [explanation of CQRS](https://matthiasnoback.nl/2018/01/simple-cqrs-reduce-coupling-allow-the-model-to-evolve/)
which keeps popping up everywhere but until now I've never really understood it.

* Check if your site has an A+ security rating with [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/).
