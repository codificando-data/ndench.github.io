#### About me

I am driven by a desire to improve in every aspect of what I do which goes hand in hand with my 
love of trying and learning new things. I enjoy the fast-paced startup environment which thrives on
the need always do things better and faster. My main areas of interest are Software Engineering, 
DevOps and Information Security. I spend my spare time playing bike polo, doing Krav Maga and 
gaming.

#### Side Projects

**DingoPM** - *2017*

While working at RedEye Apps my colleague and I identified a problem with the way we were managing
our issue registers when onboarding clients. We were emailing spreadsheets back and forth with our
clients, leading confusion and miscommunication. So we undertook a couple of weeks of investigation
and user interviews with our project managers to flesh out the problem and to gain an understanding
of a potential solution.

From the investigation we build [DingoPM](https://dingo.pm), a collaborative issue log specifically
designed to increase commuincation and auditability of project issues between project managers and
their clients.

I learnt a lot from buiding DingoPM from both a technical standpoint about building a new product
from the ground up, but also from a business standpoint about the importance of user engagement and
building a product that people actually want to use.

**ShiftyBee** - *2016*

when [Tanda](https://www.tanda.co) hosted a hackathon in 2016 to mark the release of their public 
API, I decided to participate with a co-worker and together we built ShiftyBee over the course of
a weekend. ShiftyBee integrated with the Tanda API to allow Tandas clients (fast-food and retail
businesses) to quickly replace a "ShiftyBee" - an employee who didn't show up for their shift.
With the click of a button it would email all employees who don't have a conflicting shift and
give them the chance to accept the shift and replace the no-show.

I had a lot of fun with this challenge, with the main learning being that writing code at 4am is
not very productive. However, we were able to get a production deploy of the app up and running
within two days, which was very exicting.

#### Work History

**Co-Founder & Software Engineer at HyraIQ** - *September 2017 - present*

I met Alastair Blenkin towards the end of 2017 when he was looking for technical co-founders to
help him create HyraIQ. After getting to know Alastair and the problem domain, I was convinced
that the idea was a winner and was super exicited to join the team. At HyraIQ we're building a
lease negotiation platform for high volume clients. Our aim is to drive the negotiation process
from many months (sometimes greater than a year), down to a few days. By working closely with our
clients, and With the help of aritficial intelligence, we can learn from previous lease 
negotiations and apply those learnings to future negotiations.

Since joining the team I have been involved in or responsible for many things, including:

* successful user interviews and user testing
* designing a great user experience flow
* automating the DevOps and CI/CD processes
* writing scalable and maintainable code

**Software Engineer at RedEye** - *January 2015 - September 2017*

RedEye is a startup building enterprise SAAS solutions to engineering data and workforce 
management. I worked on the RedEyeDMS product, which stores and engineering drawings and data for
some of Australia's largest asset owners. Througout my time there I held many different roles and 
honed my skills in:

* backend development of a large and complex system
* frontend development of a solution that aims to "drive to zero" clicks for it's users
* implementing and managing the BAU process to work with users in order to solve their issues as
  quickly as possible
* running the release process to ensure the team's code is deployed quickly and efficiently
* implementing an agile development methodology to increase the effectiveness of the team

**Programmer at Topcon Positioning Systems** - *January 2014 - December 2014*

While finishing my final year at Uni I worked part time at Topcon as a programmer. It was great to
be able to apply the skills I learnt at Uni and to get a feel for how professional software 
development works. My most notable achievement at Topcon was building a C++ dependency manager and
build pipeline that was used by multiple dev teams to speed up their workflow.
