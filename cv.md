#### About me

I am driven by a desire to improve in every aspect of what I do which goes hand in hand with my 
love of trying and learning new things. I enjoy the fast-paced startup environment which thrives on
the need always do things better and faster. In spend my spare time playing bike polo, doing Krav 
Maga and gaming.

#### Work History

**Co-Founder & Senior Software/DevOps Engineer at HyraIQ** - *September 2017 - present*

At HyraIQ we're building a lease negotiation platform for high volume clients. Our aim is to drive
the negotiation process from many months (sometimes greater than a year), down to a few days.

Since joining the team I have been involved in or responsible for many things, including:

* successful user interviews and user testing
* designing a great user experience flow
* automating the DevOps and CI/CD processes
* writing scalable and maintainable code

**Senior Software Engineer at RedEye** - *January 2015 - September 2017*

At RedEye I worked on their RedEyeDMS product, which stores and engineering drawings and data for
some of Australia's largest asset owners. Througout my time there I held many different roles and 
honed my skills in:

* backend development of a large and complex system
* frontend development of a solution that aims to "drive to zero" clicks for it's users
* implementing and managing the BAU process to work with users in order to solve their issues as
  quickly as possible
* running the release process to ensure the team's code is deployed quickly and efficiently
* implementing an agile development methodology to increase the effectiveness of the team

**Software Developer at Topcon Positioning Systems** - *January 2014 - December 2014*

While finishing up at Uni I worked part time at Topcon as a programmer. I was able to apply the 
skills I learnt at Uni and to get a feel for how professional software development works. My most 
notable achievement at Topcon was building a C++ dependency manager and build pipeline that was 
used by multiple dev teams to speed up their workflow.

#### Side Projects

**DingoPM** - *2017*

While working at RedEye Apps my colleague and I identified a problem with the way we were managing
our issue registers when onboarding clients. After some initial investigation and user interviews
we developed [DingoPM](https://dingo.pm), a collaborative issue log designed to increase 
commuincation around project issues.

I learnt a lot from buiding DingoPM from both a technical standpoint about building a new product
from the ground up, but also from a business standpoint about the importance of user engagement and
building a product that people actually want to use.

**ShiftyBee** - *2016*

I participated in the [2016 Tanda hackathon](https://www.tanda.co/brisbanes-largest-hackathon-2016/)
with a co-worker. Together we built ShiftyBee over the course of a weekend which integrates with 
the Tanda API to allow Tanda's clients (fast-food and retail businesses) to quickly replace a 
"ShiftyBee" - an employee who didn't show up for their shift. With the click of a button it 
organises for an available employee to cover the shift. We were able to get a production deploy of 
the app up and running within two days, which was very exicting.

#### Education

**University of Queensland** - *January 2011 - June 2014*

UQ helped me lay the foundations for a career in software development. My courses ranged from
Operating Systems to Cryptography but mainly focused around my major of Software Design. I 
graduated with a Bachelor of Information Technology.


#### Volunteer Experience

**Mentor for Django Girls Brisbane** - *2016 & 2017*

[Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) is a global non-profit which helps women get into the 
software industry by running free one-day programming workshops. I volunteered as a mentor for the 
Brisbane workshops in 2016 and 2017. My role to help a small group of women to build a blog using 
the Django framework in Python.

**Lead Mentor at CoderDojo Brisbane** - *March 2015 - September 2016*

[CoderDojo](https://coderdojobrisbane.com.au/) is a global movement of volunteers running free 
coding clubs for young children. I volunteered for the Brisbane branch which is run by the Brisbane
City Council and runs two hour workshops for children during school terms. I taught the children
aspects of software ranging from running a Linux machine, to building a basic website and using 
algorithms such as binary search.
