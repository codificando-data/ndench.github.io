1. Fork the repository you want to update
2. Create a branch in your repository (eg. "fix-foo"), choose one that's not already in use.
3. Add your fork to your composer.json

```json
...
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/<username>/<repo name>"
        }
    ]
...
```
NOTE: Don't update the `"require"` block, it will still point to the original `<vendor>/<repo name>`.

4. Install your fork from source:
```bash
composer require --prefer-source <vendor>/<repo name>:dev-<branch name>
```

NOTE: This means that you'll have your git repo cloned at `vendor/<vendor>/<repo name>`, meaning
you can update it in the context of your project and test it with your project.
