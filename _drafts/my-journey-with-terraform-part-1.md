- intro
    - why I like terraform
    - it's scary
    - why I'm writing this
- I used it to create a single web instance with a domain name
    - on top of existing vpc, with existing AMI
    - easy to destroy and re-create
    - store the state in git
- conclusion
    - don't have to go all in, can start small
    - I was intrigued, but not super keen yet
